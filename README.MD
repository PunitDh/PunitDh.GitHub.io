### **Target Audience**
I have close to 20 years experience programming in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and other languages. I intended to create a portfolio website that showcased my work also while maintaining a clean, modern website. I looked around for inspiration and I really liked Harry Frankel's website (who is my instructor). I then reverse-engineered some of the elements of the website I really liked, along with several other elements from many different sources around the web to create a sleek, modern website that would suit my needs.

I used the learning material I learned from our online video lessons to design the "box hover buttons" on the `index.html` page. I added a 3D mouse-over effect after seeing a tutorial for it on the W3 website.

I decided to create my portfolio to show how I can create clean, modern, and stylish websites through my own portfolio. The intended target audience for this portfolio is any prospective employer or client looking for a web designer to fit their needs, and wants to learn more about me and my abilities.

I also intend to showcase all my side-projects and hobbies, interests, skills and personality. I designed this website in the hopes that I will be directed to work with exciting, interesting people and corporations to design web applications to meet their needs.
