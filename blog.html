            </H2>
            <aside class="blog-post-date">Posted 23 Jun 2021</aside>
            <p>Growing up, I was always fascinated by artificial intelligence. Getting a machine that is made up of
                lights and switches and 1s and 0'sâ€™ to think and act like a human would. I spent a long time tinkering
                with and learning about finite state machines (FSMs), behaviour trees and motion planning. Itâ€™s an area
                Iâ€™m passionate about, would love to explore further and would like to possibly pursue as a career one
                day.</p>

            <p>As part of my coding bootcamp, we were given the task of building a Ruby terminal based application. I
                decided to test my skills and knowledge, and challenge myself by building a Tic Tac Toe game, one where
                the computer responds intelligently. I aimed to make the game as realistic as possible, one where a user
                would be able to play with minimal instructions, and it would mimic the game in real life. </p>

            <p>How it works: the application starts with a main menu, where the user selects New Game, and are then
                asked to choose between single and multi-player mode. Multiplayer mode allows two users to play against
                each other, and the game progresses as normal â€“ the board is displayed, the computer â€˜tosses a coinâ€™
                (generates a random number) to determine who goes first. Players take turns choosing which grid square
                to play by entering the co-ordinates, and an â€˜Xâ€™ or â€˜Oâ€™ is placed there, with the aim to get three in a
                diagonal, horizontal or vertical row, with the game ending in a win or a draw. But where it gets really
                interesting, is when the player chooses to play against the computer. The application follows the same
                process as a two player game, but the other move is made by the computer, and the computer plays to win.
            </p>

            <p>The evolution of my thinking through this application started with first getting the computer to play a
                random move. I did this by creating a functionality that finds all the empty squares on the board, and
                choosing one to place the move in. A good start, but I wanted the computer to respond intelligently. To
                do this, I researched algorithms and game theory and decided on the Minimax algorithm. Often used in
                chess, this embodies the decision rule for minimising the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss)
                scenario. I refactored this to fit a Tic Tac Toe game, so it iterates through all possible moves in
                milliseconds and performs the best possible one. To showcase this, the number of moves is displayed in
                the application â€“ when the computer makes its first move of the game, it performs almost sixty thousand
                iterations. The game is then saved, and can be accessed later. </p>

            <p>In creating this game, I purposely wrote the code so that another developer would be able to learn from
                it or build upon it. The code is written to be modular, readable, and modifiable, and is well commented
                throughout in order to promote collaboration with others. </p>

            <p>One of the things I enjoyed most about creating this game was challenging myself above the requirements
                of the assignment, and pushing myself to learn more about AI and how it can be incorporated into live
                applications. Creating tests for this was really interesting as well. Rspec testing has of course been
                utilised, but in order to test as thoroughly as possible, I created a simulation mode where the player
                can set up Computer vs Computer, in order to check that the AI was indeed unbeatable. This is capped at
                a thousand games (in order to prevent infinite loops, memory leaks and system crashes) and takes about
                fourteen minutes to complete. I ultimately decided to make this a part of the final application as a
                showcase for the durability of the code and the algorithm. </p>

            <p>You can find the code for the game <a href="https://github.com/punitdh/tictactoeruby">here</a>, with a
                readme doc detailing some of the more technical aspects of how the game was put together.</p>

            <H2 class="section-heading">Taking on Dan Murphys â€“ The Precious Nectar, a two sided marketplace for wine
                collectors</H2>
            <aside class="blog-post-date">Posted 15 Jun 2021</aside>
            <p>Having worked in the wine industry for over four years, I have met a number of people that love rare
                wines, either for collection or drinking. I also worked with some of the best sales reps and wine
                connoisseurs in the country. This got me thinkingâ€¦ was there a market for a website that would cater
                specifically to them, allowing them to both sell and buy wines?</p>
            <p>We were given the assignment to create a two sided marketplace app, using Ruby on Rails, and I created
                The Precious Nectar, a site for wine lovers to both purchase and/or sell bottles of wine. The features
                of the site include a full catalogue, a search bar, a cart and transaction system, full payment
                integration, My Account functionality, a messaging system and responsive pages. I also worked
                extensively on the backend database, using PostgreSQL and creating a robust project model with active
                record associations of the User, Listing, Profile, Transaction, CartListing, Conversations and Message.
            </p>
            <p>When I was building this app, I considered the type of customers Iâ€™ve had, and what they would want out
                of a site like this. My work experience with wine has been mostly based in the eastern suburbs of
                Sydney, with often very famous and wealthy customers, like Tony Abbott and Ricky Ponting. With this type
                of premium customer in mind, I wanted a premium look for the design and UX, aiming to replicate a
                boutique shopping experience. To this end, I used the Tailwind CSS Framework, and the Font Awesome gem
                to improve the look, responsiveness and overall branding of the site. Giving users the opportunity to
                sell as well as buy was done to increase users engagement with the website, with higher browse and dwell
                times, with the aim to build customer loyalty. The purpose was to create a sense of community amongst
                members, and encourage return customers.</p>
            <p>This app also gave me a chance to further develop my skills in periphery technologies as well. The Devise
                gem and Pundit gem was used for authentication, and the Stripe gem for payments, and the Stripe Webhook
                API and Ultrahook. Using these existing frameworks allowed me to concentrate on really making them work
                within my own code, and see what further functionality could be explored, and also not to simply add
                gems for the sake of it. I also used Amazing S3 Cloud Storage for image storage, and Heroku for app
                deployment. </p>
            <p>This was a great experience in creating an application in something I had a personal interest in (I
                collect wine myself, so would obviously get first pick of all wines for sale as the site
                administrator!), and personal experience working with. I love being able to combine knowledge and skills
                from my previous life, and create a web application that I would use myself as a customer. I feel it
                gave me a unique insight into how the functionality and design of both the front and back end code would
                be best designed and deployed to meet the market needs. Creating this app in an assignment context with
                deadlines and requirements of technologies used gave me valuable real world experience, including in
                project and time management, creating wireframes, writing user stories and meeting company or client
                needs. </p>

            <H2 class="section-heading">Creating a machine coding app in less than 25 lines of code â€“ live
            </H2>
            <aside class="blog-post-date">Posted 6 Jun 2021</aside>
            <P>We were given the task in class to do a lightening talk, a ten minute or so presentation, on any topic of
                our choosing. This wasnâ€™t a graded assignment, but rather was an opportunity to practice presentation
                skills. It was great listening to others â€“ topics that ranged from Lolita fashion (a Japanese fashion
                subculture) to the different types of algorithms.</p>

            <p>When it was time to do mine, I chose to focus on a couple of interests. Iâ€™ve always been interested in
                AI, particularly machine learning. Growing up, I watched a lot of sci-fi movies (I Robot, Star Wars) and
                played a lot of sci-fi games (Mass Effect â€“ a game about fighting super-intelligent machines trying to
                take over the galaxy). I was always curious as to how you could get a machine to think like a human, and
                for the machine to actually learn from its own behaviours using some sort of data or feedback mechanism.
            </P>

            <p>I decided to use this as an opportunity to create my first machine learning app, one where it recommends
                movies to a user based on what theyâ€™ve watched previously (similar to the Netflix algorithm). To make
                this work, I learnt Python in less than six hours, though it wasnâ€™t part of the curriculum. I had to
                consider that traditional programming is about giving the computer â€˜rulesâ€™ and â€˜dataâ€™, and the computer
                coming up with an answer. Machine learning programming is the opposite. It involves giving the computer
                â€˜answersâ€™ and â€˜dataâ€™ and having the computer come up with itâ€™s on â€˜rulesâ€™ on what to do with that data.
            </p>

            <p>The app works on a simple user interface. The user is asked to enter the name of the last movie they
                watched. They are then recommended ten movies to watch. So typing in Jaws, would give the
                recommendations of Jaws 2, Jaws: The Revenge, The Reef, The Shallows, Shark Night, Shark Tale, Bait,
                Batman, Creature and Shark Life. To get these results, I learned to use the machine learning libraries
                sklearn and pandas. From the sklearn library, I used something called a Tfidfvectorizer, which stands
                for â€˜term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency vectorizerâ€™. It sounds complicated but in simple terms,
                it just counts the number of words in a document, then arranges those words in order of â€˜importanceâ€™.
                Words such as and, the and of are given less importance, and keywords and unique words are given more
                importance. A similarity table was then used to create a large 5000 x 5000 table in the computers memory
                that records the scores of how similar one movie is to another based on these keywords. I also used
                something called linear kernel, which is just a fancy buzzword for a process used to create a similarity
                table. This allowed the closest possible movie to be picked to the one the user has entered.</p>

            <p>Creating an app like this let me explore the notion of data science further. The use of scientific
                methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and
                unstructured data, and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of
                application domains. A fascinating area, and I one I will exploring further in the future.</p>

            <p>And to just to make things more interesting, I decided to try and write the code live in front of the
                class, as part of the presentation. This definitely added an extra challenge, and I was definitely happy
                when it worked! (and in less than 25 lines of code too).</p>

            <H2 class="section-heading">Going the extra mile, and how a â€˜can doâ€™ attitude helps me to become a better
                programmer
            </H2>
            <aside class="blog-post-date">Posted 6 Jun 2021</aside>
            <P>One of the things I enjoy most about programming is creating solutions. I love breaking down a challenge
                or problem and investigating all the different ways and approaches to solve it. I started off doing an
                electrical engineering degree, and very much enjoyed the problem solving aspects of it (less so the
                physics and mathematics of electricity!), and I think this has structured my way of thinking to be
                methodical, practical and has given me a desire to search out new information, knowledge and skills and
                how best to utilise these.

                During my period of study, we were given access to much theory and lectures, which Iâ€™ve really enjoyed.
                I first learnt about coding from watching YouTube when I was young, so being able to combine this with
                more structured theoretical knowledge has been invaluable. Once Iâ€™ve got a problem or challenge, I want
                to do whatever it takes to solve it. This has meant doing extra work and creating many of my own
                websites (hit me up if you want to see my website that converts hexadecimal to binary and more!) while
                fulfilling the course requirements. Iâ€™ve also signed up for additional online courses (both free and
                paid), watched many more YouTube tutorials, much reading of documentation, learning from otherâ€™s code,
                refactoring a code thatâ€™s used for one purpose and applying it to another, and some wide-ranging use of
                StackOverflow.

            <p>Some examples of this include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When I was doing the marketplace app, I couldnâ€™t figure out how to do Stripe payment integration
                    properly â€“ so I went and paid $25 USD for an online course to teach me how to do that, and got it
                    working perfectly.</li>
                <li>When I was doing the Tic Tac Toe AI for another assignment, I went down the rabbit hole of exploring
                    every algorithm I could find â€“ I finally found the â€˜minimaxâ€™ algorithm online that was written in
                    C++ and was meant for Chess. But I copied over all the logic from the Chess algorithm and rewrote
                    the code in Ruby to fit my Tic Tac Toe game</li>
                <li>I implemented the â€˜Facebook style chatâ€™ system in my marketplace app in less than 24 hours after
                    being inspired by another classmateâ€™s work. This included the full CSS to make it look like a real
                    Facebook chat, and I did this through a lot of targeted googling, blog posts, StackOverflow examples
                    and CSS components. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Iâ€™ve also really enjoyed working with other students in the class. Seeing how different people with
                different professional and study backgrounds approach a problem is fascinating, and itâ€™s great seeing
                how
                many different ways of thinking there are and how this can lead to many solutions. Helping someone with
                some
                code they are having trouble with has allowed me to learn so much more as well, and Iâ€™m really looking
                forward to being able to continue to work and collaborate with others in a professional environment.</p>

            <aside class="blog-post-date">Posted 5 Jun 2021</aside>
            <P>One of the things that drives me most about programming is the ability to make something happen on
                screen. I love that I am creating something that didnâ€™t exist before, watching it evolve with each
                feature and line of code added. I also like to think of the code itself as itâ€™s own work of art. Each
                feature named perfectly. Each class itâ€™s own entity. Tests that prepare for any eventuality. Going
                through the code again and again, making sure itâ€™s as DRY and clean as possible, and itâ€™s readable by
                other developers. </p>

            <p>I also really enjoy being able to break a task down into parts. When studying, it was often quite
                overwhelming when each assignment was released. Each one had multiple requirements that had to be
                fulfilled, separate to actually creating a functional website. I found it best to work through these
                methodically, breaking each part into a manageable section so I could start planning and preparing for
                it. For a couple of the assignments, I actually built a quick and rough website first, just to get used
                to how the languages worked together. Then I would work through the set of tasks. For me, the harder the
                task, the more satisfying it is to finish. </p>

            <p>I think in programming, thereâ€™s always going to be a new challenge. And just when you think youâ€™ve solved
                one, another one comes along. It can be difficult to continuously face challenges, but I think the
                bigger the challenge, the more interesting it is. I find being able to solve to constantly solve
                problems very rewarding, and have a real hunger to find not only a solution, but the best possible
                solution. </p>

            <p>Because everyone has to have a side hustle these days (lol), I also have a side business as a life coach
                practitioner. Life coaching is all about communicating with people in a way that <em>they</em>
                understand (as
                opposed to communicating in a way that <em>I</em> understand) â€“ I see programming in a similar way.
                Programming
                is about communicating with a computer in a way that the <em>computer</em> understands. I think life
                coaching has
                taught me about seeing things from other perspectives, different ways of communicating and
                comprehending; and that approach can be brought to programming. I think also being able to break a
                problem, challenge or even just a situation down into manageable parts, and then working through those
                parts is also a really valuable skill to be able to share with others.
