            <article class="content">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
                Ipsum has been the
                industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
                into
                electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                release of
                Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
                Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</article>

            <H2 class="section-heading">Life Coaching & Public Speaking</H2>
            <article class="content">
                <P>I studied Diploma of Life Coaching in 2019-2020 and am also a trained public speaker.</P>
                <P>
                    I majority of last year building a life coaching practice. I run workshops in the consumer space.
                    I enjoy helping people build relationship skills, emotional intelligence and communication skills.

                    I am majorly into personal development and I follow some of the biggest personal development gurus
                    such as Tony Robbins, Dr DeMartini and Dr Robert Glover.
                    I regularly get involved in Menâ€™s Groups to help men around Sydney overcome their issues with
                    confidence and self-image.
                </P>
                <P>The reason I would like to apply for this role is because I am certain that I can bring something of
                    value to your organisation, but also get a lot back. Here are some of the reasons why I should be
                    considered for the position:</P>
                <UL>
                    <LI> I have a STRONG customer service background (7 years) and also 1 year of management experience
                        (great with people) </LI>
                    <LI>I have previous experience working at a reception desk, so answering phones and performing admin
                        duties to me is second-nature </LI>
                    <LI>I am a trained public speaker and have received a Speakersâ€™ Training certificate </LI>
                    <LI>I absolutely LOVE content creation, as I need to do it from time-to-time in the coaching
                        practice</LI>
                    <LI>I have strong computer skills due to previously holding an engineering degree</LI>
                    <LI>I can navigate Facebook and Instagram easily and regularly use it for my coaching practice</LI>
                    <LI>I have used Canva and other similar image creation tools in the past to create social media
                        flyers for Singlesâ€™ Events (I used to host them)</LI>
                    <LI>I donâ€™t have much experience using Halaxy, but if itâ€™s like any other software then I am sure I
                        would be able to learn it very quickly</LI>
                </UL>
                Here are the couple of things Iâ€™m looking to get from this role:
                - Looking to understand more about the mental health industry, as I feel most at home in that space
                - Looking to grow my skills and become a master content creator
                - Looking to grow my experience delivering workshops, public speaking and workshop design
                - Looking to grow my client acquisition, marketing and sales skills
                - Looking to use my creativity, spontaneity, my passion and my drive in a field that actually matters!
